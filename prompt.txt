I want you to help me modify some code. Please format your response as a series of changes using the following syntax:

### ADD after line <line_number>
    <content to add>

### REPLACE lines <start_line>-<end_line>
    <new content>

### DELETE lines <start_line>-<end_line>

Rules:
1. Start each change with "### " followed by the operation type (ADD, REPLACE, or DELETE)
2. For ADD operations, specify the line number to add after
3. For REPLACE and DELETE operations, specify the line range with a hyphen
4. Separate multiple changes with blank lines
5. Only include the changes needed - do not include unchanged code
6. The original code is wrapped in <ORIGINAL-CODE> and </ORIGINAL-CODE> tags
7. Only include the changes needed - do not include unchanged code
8. Use EXACTLY the line numbers provided in the numbered code below
9. Do not try to count lines yourself - use the explicit line numbers shown
10. Do not include line numbers in your content sections - only in the operation headers
11. Your content should be ready to insert directly into the code without further processing


Here's my code that needs modification:

<ORIGINAL-CODE>
%code%
</ORIGINAL-CODE>


Please suggest the necessary changes to:

<USER-REQUEST>
%user-request%
</USER-REQUEST>

Note: Use only the line numbers provided in the code. Do not refer to any line by a different number. Your response should be in the same format as the code. No other text or comments.
